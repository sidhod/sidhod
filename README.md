### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me

ðŸŽ“ I am Sidhodhan Kamble, a **Java Devloper**,**Front End Web Developer**  and  **App Devloper** . I completed Bachelor in **Instrumentation and Control & engineering** and will graduate in mid-2022.

ðŸŽ¸ Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **guitar**, **break dancing (hip-hop)**, **sketching**, and **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **writing with my left hand**.
